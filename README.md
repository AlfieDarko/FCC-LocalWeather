FreeCodeCamp Local Weather App
<br><br>

Created a Local Weather App using various API's. I had to use an IP Location API since getting geolocation by browser automatically has been depreciated in google chrome.

The weather Icon changes according to what type of weather it is and what time of day it is. All this information is returned to us by the openweather API and parsed accordingly. I used bootstrap for the simple grid system and abit of Jquery for my AJAX requests.
